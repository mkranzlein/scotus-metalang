       "     'text': \"Twenty years, four -- four counts of five years.\\nBut the computation is a question whether he had yet started the service as -- as second of his third five years, but in 1943, at which time Judge Duncan had succeeded Judge Collet as the District Judge in that division, Judge Collet having been promoted to the Eighth Circuit bench.\\nA motion was filed on his behalf requesting that the remaining sentences yet to be served, either the third, fourth, and fifth counts or the fourth and fifth, that the execution of the sentence as yet to be served be suspended and be placed on probation.\\nNow, in -- two months prior to the filing of the motion on behalf of the petitioner in the District Court, Judge Reeves, another division of the Western District had ruled in the case of Phillips versus the United States for the facts as far as sentences are concerned, were identical with the facts in this case, and that Phillips, the defendant, was in the service of the first of three consecutive terms.\\nThat the Court was without jurisdiction to entertain such a motion as the term had passed and the 60 days had -- had passed when he had -- after he had been first sentenced.\\nPending the appeal of the Phillips case, Judge Duncan held in abeyance of ruling on the Affronti case.\\nOn appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the Phillips decision was affirmed.\\nOn that bench, sitting as a member of the Court of Appeals, was Judge Collet.\\nAnd in a dissenting opinion, he held that a District Court in his opinion had a right to retain jurisdiction over sentences yet to be served.\\nAfter the Phillips case was passed, the time had passed, no application was made to this Court for certiorari, although the Court of Appeals had recommended that he'd be permitted to apply without the payment of cost.\\nThe Court -- appeal was taken in the Affronti case to the same court.\\nAnd again, on that same court, Judge Collet sat as a member of the Court of Appeals.\\nFollowing the Phillips case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Phillips case.\\nJudge Collet consistently again dissenting.\\nAgain, that Court recommended that Affronti be permitted to apply for certiorari without the payment of costs.\\nThe basis of the ruling in the Phillips case, opinion by Judge Reeves, the District Judge and followed up by the Court of Appeals, was an early case passed on this Court in 1948 by the opinion written by Chief Justice Taft, Murray versus the United States, in which the facts briefly were these.\\nA man by the name of Cook had been sentenced in a Texas District Court for a total of 14 years and some months.\\nA man in Nebraska had been sentenced to three months on six counts to run concurrently.\\nAfter the defendant Murray had served one day of his three-month sentence, the sentencing judge made an order suspending the execution of that sentence and placed Murray on probation for the balance of his term.\\nShortly thereafter in Texas, the District Court in the Cook case, after the service of sentence had been began by Cook for several years at least, on the one sentence according to the opinion, the Court in that case ordered the defendant placed on probation, suspended the execution of the remaining sentence then being served.\\nUpon appeal by the Government to this Court, certiorari from the Eighth Circuit and the Fifth, I believe it was, the opinion held that having once -- once started the service of the sentence, the District Court was without power to place the defendant on probation suspend the execution of that sentence.\\nIn that case, there was no question of consecutive sentences, although perhaps, in the Cook case, the sentence actually was of sentences running consecutively.\\nBut that doesn't appear to have been of any moment at least to the Court in the Murray opinion.\\nThat created, if not confusion, at least some difference of opinions in the different circuits as to the right of the sentencing judge under the Probation Act to sentence and suspend at the same time.\\nSome courts holding that having sentenced on one count, the court could not, on remaining counts, place the -- the defendant on probation.\\nThat had been followed or there was some confusion in the various circuits or the districts, shall we say, until the Kirk case went up to the Ninth Circuit from California.\\nIn that case, three defendants had been sentenced on consecutive terms, the first two of which were seventeen and a half years and the third for two years.\\nDuring the service of the first sentence by one of the defendants, the court in that case ordered the execution, suspend the remaining sentences, and at the completion of the service of that first sentence, the defendant was to be placed on probation.\",\n",
